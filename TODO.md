- Replacing collections
  - consolidate code paths for splicing and updating ranges
- expore more efficient updating: splitting into gather and apply steps to amoritize actual full updates with expensive splice calls
- maintain formatting in updates
- improve update efficiency by not stringifying then reparsing when inserting collection, convert `serde::Value` to tree directly (tied to maintaining formatting in updates)
- Deeper serde interop
  - `From<JsonAst> for serde_json::Value`
  - `From<serde_json::Value> for JsonAst`
- Error recovering parsing
  - goal is to parse as much as possible while marking sub regions as errors
  - return type becomes `(tree, List<Error>)` always
- JSON5 parsing
- ? maintaining comments in objects when replacing object with very similar object
